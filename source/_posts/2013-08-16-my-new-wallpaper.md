Here is my new desktop wallpaper (and current blog header), one of the best shot I've taken during my MTB trips.

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="500"][![wallpaper crocione](https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2865/9419747655_fb1bdd3b8e.jpg "Wallpaper Crocione")](https://www.flickr.com/photos/alexmufatti/9419747655/ "background di alexmufatti, su Flickr") Wallpaper Crocione[/caption]

It was taken [here](https://www.google.it/maps/preview#!data=!1m4!1m3!1d3265!2d8.6702513!3d45.9207276!2m1!1e3&amp;fid=7) on Cuvignone pass and, on the background, you can see (from left to right): lake Varese, lake Monate and lake Maggiore.

I think it's worth a visit!
